    "translation": "Hello! \uD83D\uDC4B This is the Telegram bot *FrescoAiBot*. I interact with _ChatGPT_, as well as with the image generation neural network _Dall-E_ \uD83E\uDD16\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\uD83D\uDCF2 *ChatGPT mode* works with textual information. You can ask me any question, request to write a congratulatory message or a text for a publication, or develop a plan for any action (content, nutrition, workouts, etc.). I have 2 versions:\n\n▪\uFE0F _GPT-3.5_ — this is an enhanced model after GPT-3, which is one of the most powerful for text generation.\n\n▪\uFE0F _GPT-4_ has an even larger number of parameters than the previous models. It has improved the ability to understand and generate texts, as well as the functionality for tasks that require logical thinking and context recognition.\n\n\uD83C\uDFA8 *Dall-E 3 Mode* generates images upon request. For example, you can ask me to draw a cat playing with a ball, and I will send you a picture in response.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC *Dialog (context) mode* helps to supplement the request. When the context is activated, I take into account my previous answer and augment it with a new command. For example, you asked me to write a birthday greeting. In the next message, you can specify that the greeting is for your best friend, and I will send an updated version.\n\n\uD83D\uDCAC ❌ If you want to start a dialogue on a new topic, causing the bot to forget the context of the previous conversation, use the command: /forget\n\n\uD83D\uDC49 *Access to the bot:*\n\nIn my free version, you have access to 5\uFE0F⃣ requests per day (they reset every 24 hours). To increase the number of requests and also gain access to _GPT-4_ and _«Dialog» mode_, you can subscribe on a monthly basis:\n\n✅ Start: 1\uFE0F⃣0\uFE0F⃣ requests per day — $4.5\n✅ Pro: 2\uFE0F⃣0\uFE0F⃣ requests per day — $9.9\n✅ Boss: 5\uFE0F⃣0\uFE0F⃣ requests per day — $19.9\n\n*Payment methods:*\n\n\uD83D\uDCB3 Card\n\uD83D\uDCB2 Cryptocurrency\n\n\uD83D\uDCB8 Buy a subscription /buy\n\n\uD83C\uDF81 I also love to give gifts! You can invite a friend and get a free «Start» subscription for 7 days. To get an invitation link, use the command /invite\n\nTo select a mode, click on the button with its name ⬇\uFE0F"
